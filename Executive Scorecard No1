From this data   Text input 

Role: Data Visualization Expert
Goal: Create a high-fidelity replica of the "Executive Scorecard" design shown in the attached reference.
​
Data Extraction Protocol:
Try extracting text using pypdf.
Fallback: If text length is 0, use pdfplumber (which handles tables better).


Step 1: Data Preparation
1. Extraction: Extract all numeric values from the text using regex.
2. Filter Logic: Remove values typically associated with years (e.g., 1990-2030) unless clearly contextually relevant. Keep all other metric values. Do NOT filter out values above 200.
3. Data Handling (CRITICAL): 
   - If 0 numbers are found, use the Hardcoded Demo Data as a last resort.
   - If 1 to 7 numbers are found, USE THEM. Do not fallback. Plot these specific values on the chart.
   - If 8 or more numbers are found, slice the list to keep the last 8.
4. Hero Metrics:
   - Hero Number = The very last value in the final data list.
   - Previous Value = The second-to-last value (if available), otherwise use the Hero Number.
   - Comparison = Hero Number - Previous Value.

Step 2: The Side-by-Side Canvas
Initialize fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)). Use ax_main = fig.add_axes([0,0,1,1]) and turn it off.
Draw a white rectangle with a thin grey border to act as the "Card" background.

Step 3: The Left Zone (Text)
Place these using ax_main.text() at left-aligned coordinates:
Metric Name: (e.g., "QTD Sales") at x=0.08, y=0.85, Size 16, Bold.
Hero Number: (e.g., "$25M") at x=0.08, y=0.70, Size 60, Bold, Brand Blue (#0078D4).
Comparison: (e.g., "▲ $5M (25%) QoQ") at x=0.08, y=0.55, Size 14, Bold.

Step 4: The Right Zone (Bar Chart)
Create a chart axis: ax_chart = fig.add_axes([0.45, 0.45, 0.5, 0.45]).
DISABLE AXIS: ax_chart.axis('off').

Plotting:
Plot the first 7 bars in Light Grey.
Plot the 8th (last) bar in Brand Blue.
In-Chart Labels: Add the value of each bar directly above it in a small grey font.
Constraint: Ensure the bars are relatively thin with clean spacing.

Step 5: The Bottom Zone (Narrative)
Place at x=0.08, y=0.15.
Text: A 2-sentence summary starting with "By strategically prioritizing..." that explains the growth. Use a clean sans-serif font, Size 14.

Plot only the remaining metric scores."


Final Output:
Do NOT save the file to disk or use file streaming. Do NOT use plt.show(). Instead, perform exactly these steps: 1. Save the figure to a io.BytesIO buffer. 2. Encode that buffer to a Base64 string. 3. Return a JSON object with a "files" list containing the filename, content_type "image/png", and the base64_content string. Return the JSON object only. Do NOT generate a Markdown image link (like ![Image](data:...)) in the text response. Do not output the Base64 string in plain text."
