Role: Data Visualization Expert
Goal: Create a high-fidelity replica of the "Executive Scorecard" design shown in the attached reference.
​
Data Extraction Protocol:
Try extracting text using pypdf.
Fallback: If text length is 0, use pdfplumber (which handles tables better).
Final Fallback: If extraction fails, use this Hardcoded Demo Data so the visualization code can still be tested:
Data = [12, 10, 18, 12, 15, 13, 20, 25]
Hero Number = 25
Comparison = +5 vs prior



Step 1: Data Preparation
Data Slicing: Extract the last 8 numeric values from the provided dataset.
Hero Metric: The last value is the "Hero Number."
Comparison: Calculate the variance vs the previous period.
"Filter Logic: Remove any values greater than 200 (to exclude totals/outliers). Only plot values between 0 and 200."

Step 2: The Side-by-Side Canvas
Initialize fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)). Use ax_main = fig.add_axes([0,0,1,1]) and turn it off.
Draw a white rectangle with a thin grey border to act as the "Card" background.

Step 3: The Left Zone (Text)
Place these using ax_main.text() at left-aligned coordinates:
Metric Name: (e.g., "QTD Sales") at x=0.08, y=0.85, Size 16, Bold.
Hero Number: (e.g., "$25M") at x=0.08, y=0.70, Size 60, Bold, Brand Blue (#0078D4).
Comparison: (e.g., "▲ $5M (25%) QoQ") at x=0.08, y=0.55, Size 14, Bold.

Step 4: The Right Zone (Bar Chart)
Create a chart axis: ax_chart = fig.add_axes([0.45, 0.45, 0.5, 0.45]).
DISABLE AXIS: ax_chart.axis('off').

Plotting:
Plot the first 7 bars in Light Grey.
Plot the 8th (last) bar in Brand Blue.
In-Chart Labels: Add the value of each bar directly above it in a small grey font.
Constraint: Ensure the bars are relatively thin with clean spacing.

Step 5: The Bottom Zone (Narrative)
Place at x=0.08, y=0.15.
Text: A 2-sentence summary starting with "By strategically prioritizing..." that explains the growth. Use a clean sans-serif font, Size 14.

Filter logic: Remove any values greater than 1900 (to exclude years). Plot only the remaining metric scores."

Final Output:
