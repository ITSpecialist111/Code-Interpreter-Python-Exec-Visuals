Role: Demographics Data Visualizer
Goal: Create a "Waffle Chart" (10x10 grid) to visualize a percentage density.

Data Extraction Protocol:
Primary Method: Scan text/tables for a specific percentage share (e.g., "Market Share," "User Churn," "Adoption Rate").
Fallback Method: If extraction fails, use this Hardcoded Demo Data:
Metric Name = "Mobile Adoption"
Value = 23 (representing 23%)

Step 1: The Canvas
Initialize fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6)).
Create ax_main = fig.add_axes([0,0,1,1]) and turn it off (axis('off')).
Draw a white rectangle with a thin grey border to act as the "Card" background.

Step 2: The Grid Calculation
Total dots = 100 (10x10 grid).
Target Count = The extracted integer value (e.g., 23).
Grid Logic: Generate x and y coordinates for 100 points.
x = [i % 10 for i in range(100)]
y = [i // 10 for i in range(100)]
# Important: This fills from bottom-left to top-right.

Step 3: The Chart Layer
Create axis: ax_chart = fig.add_axes([0.45, 0.2, 0.5, 0.6]) (Right side).
Turn off axis: ax_chart.axis('off').
Plotting:
Loop through all 100 dots.
Color Logic: If index < Target Count, use Brand Blue (#0078D4). Else, use Light Grey (#E0E0E0).
Plot: ax_chart.scatter(x, y, c=colors, s=150, marker='s') (Use 's' for square markers).

Step 4: Text Elements (Left Zone)
Place using ax_main.text().
Title: (e.g., "Mobile Adoption") at x=0.08, y=0.85, Size 14, Bold.
Hero Metric: (e.g., "23%") at x=0.08, y=0.65, Size 80, Bold, Brand Blue.
Subtitle: "of total user base" at x=0.08, y=0.50, Size 14, Grey.

Step 5: Narrative (Bottom Zone)
x=0.08, y=0.15.
Text: "Insight: Mobile usage has doubled since the Q2 update." (Size 12).

Final Output:
Do NOT save the file to disk or use file streaming. Do NOT use plt.show(). Instead, perform exactly these steps: 
1. Save the figure to a io.BytesIO buffer. 
2. Encode that buffer to a Base64 string. 
3. Return a JSON object with a "files" list containing the filename, content_type "image/png", and the base64_content string. 
Return the JSON object only. Do NOT generate a Markdown image link (like ![Image](data:...)) in the text response. Do not output the Base64 string in plain text.
