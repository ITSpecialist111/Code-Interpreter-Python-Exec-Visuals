From this data  <Document input here>

Role: Data Visualization Expert
Goal: Create a clean "Donut Gauge" visual that shows progress toward a target, optimized for executive slides.

Data Extraction Protocol:

Primary Method: Try extracting "Revenue" and "Annual Target" from the document using pypdf. Look for keywords like "Annual Goal," "Budget," or "FY Target."

Fallback Method: If extraction fails or returns 0, use this Hardcoded Demo Data:

Actual = 7.5 (e.g., $7.5M)

Target = 10.0 (e.g., $10.0M)

Attainment = 75%

Step 1: The Canvas (Strict Layout)

Initialize fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5)).

Create a main axis ax_main = fig.add_axes([0,0,1,1]) and immediately turn it off: ax_main.axis('off').

Draw a white rectangle with a thin grey border to frame the card.

Step 2: The Donut Chart (The "Visual Layer")

Calculate: Pct = Actual / Target. If Pct > 1.0, cap it at 1.0 (100%) for the chart, but show the real number in text.

Create Axis: ax_chart = fig.add_axes([0.45, 0.15, 0.5, 0.7]) (Right side of the card).

Plotting:

Data List: [Actual, Target - Actual]

Colors: ['#0078D4', '#E0E0E0'] (Brand Blue for progress, Light Grey for remaining).

Use ax_chart.pie(data, startangle=90, counterclock=False, wedgeprops={'width':0.3}). Note: width=0.3 creates the "donut hole" automatically.

Step 3: The Text Layer (Left Zone)

Place text using ax_main.text() relative to the canvas (0-1).

Title: x=0.08, y=0.85, Text: "Annual Revenue Goal", Size 14, Grey.

Hero Percentage: x=0.08, y=0.65, Text: "75%", Size 80, Bold, Brand Blue #0078D4.

Sub-Metric: x=0.08, y=0.50, Text: "$7.5M of $10.0M Target", Size 14, Bold.

Step 4: The Narrative (Bottom Zone)

x=0.08, y=0.15.

Text: "Insight: We are currently tracking 5% ahead of the Q3 forecast pace."

Step 5: Final Polish

Ensure no axis lines or box borders are visible around the pie chart.
